States Ranked by Rates of Prostate Cancer

As the new year begins, many people are thinking about ways to kick start their health routine. Most of us think about eating healthier or exercising more, but getting a check-up at the doctor's office could also go a long way for long-term health. Many health problems can be overlooked if one isn't careful. For instance, among men, prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer.

Although prostate cancer is relatively slow growing in most cases, it can require intensive treatment including radiation, chemotherapy, cryotherapy and surgery. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the biggest risk factors for prostate cancer are age, genetics and race (African-American men are more likely to develop the condition at higher rates and younger ages). Recent research shows that prostate cancer is becoming more aggressive in males over 75. As men age, it is crucial that they monitor their health by getting routine check-ups and preventative scans.

Healthgrove, a health data site by Graphiq, ranked states in the U.S. based on their rates of prostate cancer. Using the most recent data (2013) from the CDC, the experts at HealthGrove found the states with the highest rates of prostate cancer per 100,000 men. This data is age-adjusted and the prostate cancer incidence rate includes men who were diagnosed with or died from prostate cancer in 2013. The list is ordered from the lowest to highest rate of prostate cancer.

Although Florida, Hawaii and Maine have a high percentage of older citizens, they rank very low in terms of prostate cancer rates. Southern and North-Eastern states top the list, which could singnal that environmental factors are also very important.
