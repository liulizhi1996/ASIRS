Ranking Applebee's Fattiest Menu Items

If you live in America, you probably aren't very far away from your local Applebee's. After opening an Applebee's restaurant in Hawaii in October, the restaurant chain now has locations in every state.

However, after dwindling sales, Applebee's launched a $75 million overhaul of its menu earlier this year, replacing all of its gas-powered grills with its trademark wood-fired grill.

In anticipation of the changes, HealthGrove, a health research site powered by Graphiq, took a closer look at the healthiness of Applebee's food. Using nutritional information from the restaurant, the team found the 55 fattiest items on the menu.

HealthGrove used dishes from the dinner menu, lunch menu and kid's menu to determine which food item was fattiest. They've also included descriptions of each dish, which come from either the Applebee's website or their physical menu.

Items are ranked from lowest to highest amount of fat, with the fattiest meal at Applebee's at No. 1. In the case of a tie, meals with more calories were ranked higher; if still tied, dishes that have more sugar were given a higher rank.

Two salads are among the five fattiest foods at Applebee's. These findings are similar to another story by HealthGrove that found 40 cheeseburgers with fewer calories than a Caesar salad from The Cheesecake Factory.
