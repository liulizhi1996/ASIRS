Americans in These Places Rarely See a Doctor

Going to the doctor isn't exactly on the top of everyone's to-do list, especially when you feel relatively healthy and don't see the need for an annual check-up. However, receiving preventative care can save you a lot of money and discomfort later on. Afflictions including high blood pressure, skin cancer and high cholesterol can all be detected by doctors long before we notice there is a problem.

Still, people avoid going to the doctor. A 2015 survey published by the medical scheduling company ZocDoc said that 80 percent of Americans delay preventative care. In the same survey, 93 percent of millennials confirmed that they avoided doctor visits as well. 
Considering so many of us are choosing not to see the doctor, HealthGrove, a health data site by Graphiq, found out which U.S. metropolitan areas have been avoiding the doctor's office the most.

The experts at HeathGrove collected and analyzed 2015 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to identify the areas of the U.S. where people rarely visit the doctor. In the BRFSS survey, respondents answered the question, "About how long has it been since you last visited a doctor for a routine checkup?" Metropolitan areas are ranked based on the percentage of people who hadn't gotten a checkup in over five years. Areas are ranked from lowest to highest percentage.

In 12 of the areas on this list, more than 10 percent of their residents acknowledge that they have not seen a doctor in over five years. Many of these areas are sparsely populated regions in states like North Dakota, Alaska and Idaho, where the closest doctor may be difficult to get to. With health care coverage possibly in the balance for millions of Americans, it's important to recognize the areas in the country where people aren't currently going to the doctor â€” despite having coverage.
