The Most Caloric Cheesecake Factory Menu Items

As the name suggests, The Cheesecake Factory is best known for its delicious dairy cakes. But the restaurant also offers full-course meals ranging from steak dinners to pastas. And that menu is only getting bigger. It’s clear people love The Cheesecake Factory. Some, so much that they even took their engagement photos there.

But what is the health impact of this Cheesecake Factory love affair on its patrons?

The team at HealthGrove, a health and nutrition data site by Graphiq, decided to investigate the most caloric items on The Cheesecake Factory menu. Using nutrition data from the restaurant, HealthGrove made a list of all the items on the menu containing 1,500 or more calories and ranked them in order of lowest to highest. Note that this doesn’t include beverages, side dishes and shared dishes. Ties were broken based on sodium content, as information about fat was unavailable on the company’s website.

Cheesecake fans will be relieved that the most caloric menu item is not one of the restaurant’s eponymous desserts. In fact, desserts don’t even rank in the top 29 most caloric items on the menu. Dessert-wise, the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake comes in as the most caloric sweet on the menu, followed (surprisingly) by the healthy-sounding Carrot Cake. Outside of deserts, pasta dishes were among the most caloric at the restaurant, occupying five of the top 10 spots.
