These American Counties Have the Lowest Rates of Heart Disease

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., responsible for more than 610,000 deaths annually, according to the CDC.

While overall rates of heart disease are high in the U.S., certain regions are less affected than others. Using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, HealthGrove, a health research site by Graphiq, found the counties with the lowest percentages of Medicare beneficiaries with ischemic heart disease in 2014.

Also known as coronary heart disease or coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease is caused by the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries. It is the most common type of heart disease in the U.S. For context, HealthGrove also included on each slide the percentage of the Medicare population who have experienced heart failure.

Counties in the Western states tend to have lower rates of ischemic heart disease, dominating the top 25 spots. Only one county from the Midwest managed to crack the top 10, while no Southern states make the top 50. In general, Southern cities are prone to higher rates of heart disease. Such regional variation could stem from differences in rates of obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and smoking — all of which are risk factors for heart disease. Many of the counties in the ranking also have small populations, which could affect the overall rates.

Again, it’s important to note that the data here only looks at the rates of heart disease among Medicare beneficiaries, not the total population. Medicare covers people 65 and older, as well as certain younger people with disabilities.
