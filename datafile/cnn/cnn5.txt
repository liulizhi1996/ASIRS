Energy Bars That Are Worse to Eat Than a Snickers

When people reach for an energy bar, they’re probably thinking that it’s a healthier choice than a candy bar. Given the marketing tactics for energy and protein bars, this assumption isn’t surprising.

What’s surprising is that this assumption is often false.

Many energy bars have more sugar and calories than a regular-sized Snickers candy bars.

Using data from the ESHA nutrition database, the analysts at HealthGrove, a health research site powered by Graphiq, found 23 energy bars that have more sugar than a regular-sized Snickers. These energy bars all have over 20 grams of sugar, and some even contain close to 100 percent the daily recommended amount — 24 grams for women and 36 grams for men.

So, yes, these bars will definitely supply energy, but probably not the long and sustained energy that a meal with balanced protein, carbohydrates and fat would provide.

However, this is not to say that all energy bars are bad — some can be quite healthy. Bars can help fuel you up for a workout or sustain you from lunch to dinner. And, sometimes people such as athletes will reach for energy bars specifically because they have such high concentrations of sugar. Regardless, it’s important to be mindful of their nutrient content and remember that it's usually healthier to fuel up with whole, unprocessed foods instead.

Without further ado, here are 23 energy bars with more sugar than a Snickers.
