Ranking the Sugariest Candies

All candies are not created equal. If you’re chasing a sugar high — or trying to avoid one — you need to know which package to reach for on the shelf, and the answer isn’t always as obvious as you might think.

While it’s unlikely that candy will ever be classified as healthy fare, some confections have a lot more sugar jam-packed into their bright-colored packaging than others.

That's why the data experts at HealthGrove, a health data site by Graphiq, compiled a list of candies with the most sugar per serving. The research team gathered nutrition information from manufacturers’ websites; therefore, some serving sizes are reported in units, grams or ounces. When available, single-serving packages were considered.

The candies are ordered from least to most sugar, with the sweetest offender taking the No. 1 spot. Ties in sugar content were broken first by the number of calories per serving, and subsequent ties were broken based on fat content. Only candies currently available for purchase made the list.

Everyone’s taste buds are different, but you'll need a serious sweet tooth to enjoy the candies that make this list. Keep reading to find out whether Sour Skittles or Starburst Jellybeans take the cake as the sugariest candy.
