The Most Active Places in America

How active is the U.S.? A 2012 study by The Lancet analyzed levels of physical activity in countries around the world and found that 40.5 percent of adults in the U.S. were physically inactive. That’s higher than several other developed countries, including Australia (37.9 percent), Canada (33.9 percent) and Germany (28 percent).

But within the U.S., levels of physical activity vary widely. In Vermont, for instance, 65.3 percent of adults were found to exercise regularly, compared to 46.5 percent in Delaware. With that in mind, HealthGrove, a health data site by Graphiq, used 2015 data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to find the most active cities in America.

The CDC gathers data on a variety of health measures through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which surveys more than 400,000 adults every year. One of the questions asked is “During the past month, did you participate in any physical activities?” HealthGrove ranked metropolitan areas by the percentage of respondents who answered "yes" to this question, and included responses to other related questions for context. Note that BRFSS reports data for metropolitan statistical areas, which may span multiple states. The Logan metro area, for instance, consists of counties in both Utah and Idaho, even though the city of Logan is only in Utah.

Western states dominate the ranking. Eight of the top 10 most active cities are located in the West, with four in California alone. Although Southern metro areas generally have the lowest levels of physical activity, some do make the top 50 most active, including Raleigh, North Carolina, and Charleston, South Carolina.
