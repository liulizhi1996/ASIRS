People in These States Have Cut Out Tobacco the Most

Smoking rates have declined in the U.S. from 20.9 percent of adults in 2005 to 16.8 percent of adults in 2014. Even so, the CDC estimates that 40 million adults currently smoke cigarettes, accounting for more than 480,000 deaths every year.

While smoking levels are down overall, some states have seen greater decreases than others. HealthGrove, a health research site powered by Graphiq, found the states where people are cutting out smoking the most.

Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the data experts found the absolute difference between the percent of adults who smoked cigarettes in 2011 and the percent of adults who smoked cigarettes in 2015 in each state. For reference, the team also included the excise tax on cigarettes, which can indicate how tobacco-friendly a state is. Ties are broken by the excise tax rate.

On average, states cut down tobacco use by 3.5 percentage points, but the numbers range from just over 1 percentage point to nearly 6 percentage points. Smoking rates tend to be highest in Southern and Midwest states and lowest in Western states.
