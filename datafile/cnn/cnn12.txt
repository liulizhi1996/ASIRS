The Best Foods for Brain Health

The brain comprises between 1-2 percent of a human’s body weight, but uses approximately 20 percent of all calories consumed. Those three pounds of neuronal mass control who we are and how we stay alive — no small feat.

This caloric consumption is only suitable for arguably the body’s most important organ. The brain primarily uses glucose for energy and many scientists argue that specific nutrients help the brain more than others.

As such, the experts at HealthGrove, a health research site that’s part of the Graphiq network, created a Brain Health Index that evenly weights omega 3s and vitamin E and is scaled from 0-100, and pared out obscure foods to compile the final list.

Some researchers have long believed that vitamin E and omega 3 fatty acids support brain and nervous system health. Vitamin E is known to function as an antioxidant, disabling free-radicals in the body that can cause cellular damage. Omega 3 fatty acids have been shown to help longevity, cognitive function and neuronal health. These fatty acids are essential, and since our bodies do not produce them naturally, we must get them from our diets.

Though some of the items on this list probably don’t make it on to your regular grocery shopping list, your brain might appreciate it if you gave them a try.
