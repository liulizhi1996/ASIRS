Breakfast Cereals With More Sugar Than a Scoop of Ice Cream

Often cited as the most important meal of the day, breakfast should be as nutritious and delicious as possible. But with today's chaotic, on-the-go lifestyle shared by many professionals and families, it's hard to find a morning option that is easy and gets you out of the door quickly.

Many choose cereal as their go-to for this very reason â€” it's a no fuss breakfast option that comes in many different flavors and textures. But while many brands may boast about their cereals' fiber and low-cholesterol content, far more are brimming with added sugar.

HealthGrove, a health and nutrition data site by Graphiq, identified the breakfast cereals with more sugar than a scoop of ice cream. 
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a standard 1/2 cup serving of vanilla ice cream contains 14 grams of sugar, so HealthGrove found 24 cereals that exceed 14 grams of sugar per serving and ranked them from least to most sugary. Keep in mind that serving sizes vary from box to box. If there was a tie, the cereal with more calories and then fat was deemed less healthy and therefore ranked higher.
