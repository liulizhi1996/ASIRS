The Most Caloric Items at Red Robin

Fans of Red Robin’s burgers should rejoice: The restaurant chain recently announced that it would debut the award-winning Billion Dollar Baby burger nationwide for a limited time.

The Billion Dollar Baby contains a Black Angus beef patty, topped with a fried potato cake, truffle-flavored cheese blend, melted Fontina cheese, mayo and peppered bacon. Because why not throw bacon into a sizzling mix of beef, cheese and potato? As the company’s senior vice president notes: “At Red Robin, we are pushing the boundaries.”

While “pushing the boundaries” might mean tastier burgers, it doesn’t necessarily mean healthier. To get a better sense of how nutritious Red Robin dishes are, HealthGrove, a health and nutrition research site by Graphiq, found some of the most caloric items on the menu. Dishes are ranked by calories, but the team also included each item’s fat, sugar and sodium content to provide more nutritional context. Ties are broken by an item’s fat content.

As expected, Red Robin’s famed burgers dominate the top 10, although they lose out on the top three spots. Remarkably, the most caloric item on the menu has over 2,100 calories and contains more than 235 percent of the of the daily recommended fat intake.
