County in Every State With the Most Deaths From Alzheimer's Disease

As humans push the bounds of longevity and health, certain diseases become more prevalent in society. Many of these diseases are those that disproportionately affect older people — such as Alzheimer’s and cancer.

In order to determine which U.S. counties have the most deaths to Alzheimer’s per 100,000 people, the experts at HealthGrove, a health data site powered by Graphiq, examined 2014 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

From 1900 to today, the average lifespan in most countries increased from approximately 50 to 80 years old. Many developed and developing countries are starting to see the effects of this. For example, in the United States, the baby boomer generation has hit its senior years. The youngest boomers today are 52 years old, while the oldest are 70.

Though the “millennial” generation is arguably catching up to the boomers in size, the U.S. overall is still an aging nation. And the increase in incidences and deaths of Alzheimer’s disease is just one indication of many.

While some counties may have higher rates of Alzheimer’s deaths than others, the financial burden of an aging population and increased prevalence of this disease will be shouldered by the younger generations of the entire country.
